# {{title}} ðŸŽ¹

_airportpianos.org_ is devoted to helping more airports find pianos. Started in 2023, this site serves two purposes. First, to document airport pianos around the world. Second, to provide resources for people who want to donate pianos to airports.

This project is run by [capjamesg](https://jamesg.blog).

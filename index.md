# {{title}} üéπ

_airportpianos.org_ is devoted to helping more airports find pianos.

This site is a collection of resources for piano donors. We hope to, over time, write documentation on:

1. How to contact an airport about making a donation
2. Costs associated with donating a piano (e.g. moving, tuning, maintenance)
3. The logistics involved with making a donation

## How to Contact an Airport

### Finding Contact Information

- Contact the media relations department if one is advertised on the airport's website;
- Contact the organization that operates the terminal. For example, the terminals at Des Moines International Airport are administered by the Des Moines Airport Authority. The terminal operator can advise on the best way to proceed.

### Facilitating an Ask

When emailing an airport, you should cover:

- An ask on whether the airport is interested in a piano;
- Whether you have a personal piano to donate, or are willing to donate a piano on behalf of an organization;
- Whether you are willing to pay for the piano to be moved to the airport;
- Asn ask on the logistics of moving the piano to the airport.

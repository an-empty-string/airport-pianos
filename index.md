_airportpianos.org_ is devoted to helping more airports find pianos.

This site is a collection of resources for piano donors. We hope to, over time, write documentation on:

1. How to contact an airport about making a donation
2. Costs associated with donating a piano (e.g. moving, tuning, maintenance)
3. The logistics involved with making a donation
